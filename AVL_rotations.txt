AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. The height of the tree is always O(log n). AVL trees are named after inventors Adelson-Velskii and Landis, who published the first description of them in 1962. 
AVL trees are often compared with red-black trees because both support the same set of operations and take O(log n) time for the basic operations. AVL trees are more rigidly balanced than red-black trees, leading to slower insertion and deletion but faster retrieval. AVL trees are used in many database and language libraries as their primary dictionary data structure. 
AVL trees are a good choice when it is important that the tree remain balanced.
